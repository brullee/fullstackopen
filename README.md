## Course information

The project is developed as part of the Full Stack Open curriculum.  
Each part of the course is implemented incrementally as I progress through the material.

## Technologies used

### Frontend

- React (components, state, props, forms)
- Conditional rendering and event handling

### Backend

- Express.js (REST API creation, routing, middleware)
- dotenv (environment variables)
- CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)
- Mongoose validation (schema-level validation)

### Database

- MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)
- Mongoose (schemas, models, queries: `find`, `findOne`, `findById`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, `findByIdAndDelete`)

### HTTP & API

- REST principles (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Axios (for fetching data from frontend to backend)

### Testing / API Tools

- supsertest (a package that helps with writing tests)
- Postman (GUI tool for testing API endpoints)
- REST Client (VS Code extension for testing API requests)

### Other Tools / Concepts

- JSON (data format for API communication)
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- npm (package management)
- ESLint (code linting)
- Error handling (both frontend & backend)
- Deployment basics (Render)

## Notes

The repository is updated continuously as I advance through the course exercises.
