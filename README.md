- **Phonebook:** <https://fullstackopen-part3-persons-backend.onrender.com/>

## Course progress

- **Part 0–2:** React fundamentals, component state, forms, and data fetching
- **Part 3:** Backend with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and deployment
- **Part 4:** Backend testing, user authentication, and authorization
- **Part 5:** In Progress...

## Technologies used

### Frontend

- React (components, state, props, forms, conditional rendering)
- Axios (HTTP client)

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express.js (REST API, routing, middleware)
- MongoDB & Mongoose (schemas, models, validation)
- dotenv (environment variables)
- CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)

### Authentication & Security

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Token-based authorization for protected routes
- Middleware-based authentication handling

### Testing

- Supertest (HTTP integration testing)
- Automated backend tests
  - HTTP requests with Supertest
  - API endpoints
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Database state changes

### HTTP & API

- REST principles (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- CRUD operations
- HTTP status codes
- Error handling with middleware

### Tooling & Other Concepts

- cross-env (cross-platform environment variable support)
- ESLint (code linting)
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- npm (package management)
- Postman & REST Client (manual API testing)
- Deployment with Render
